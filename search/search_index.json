It is an identifier used to distinguish one database from another within a database management system (DBMS). For example, in Oracle databases, the DB name is the unique name given to a database instance.</p> <ul> <li>Read Throughput</li> </ul> <p>Read Throughput measures the rate at which data is read from a storage system, typically in megabytes per second (MB/s) or gigabytes per second (GB/s). It indicates the performance of read operations in a database or storage environment.</p> <ul> <li>Instance Name</li> </ul> <p>Instance Name refers to the name of a specific instance of a database. A database instance is a set of memory structures and background processes that access a database. In multi-instance databases like Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters), each instance has a unique name.</p> <ul> <li>Write Throughput</li> </ul> <p>Write Throughput measures the rate at which data is written to a storage system, usually expressed in MB/s or GB/s. It indicates the performance of write operations in a database or storage environment.</p> <ul> <li>Host Name</li> </ul> <p>Host Name is the name of the server or machine where the database or application is running. It is used to identify the physical or virtual machine in a network.</p> <ul> <li>SGA (System Global Area)</li> </ul> <p>SGA is a shared memory area that contains data and control information for an Oracle database instance. It includes various memory components like the database buffer cache, shared pool, and redo log buffer, essential for database operations and performance.</p> <ul> <li>Elapsed Time</li> </ul> <p>Elapsed Time refers to the total time taken to complete a particular task or operation, from start to finish. In database performance metrics, it can represent the time taken for a query to execute or a batch process to complete.</p> <ul> <li>PGA (Program Global Area)</li> </ul> <p>PGA is a memory area that contains data and control information exclusively for a server process in Oracle databases. It is allocated when a process is started and is used for things like sort operations and session memory.</p> <ul> <li>DB Time</li> </ul> <p>DB Time is the total time spent by the database server processing user requests, including CPU time and wait time. It is a key performance metric for assessing database load and efficiency.</p> <ul> <li>Read IOPS</li> </ul> <p>Read IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) measures the number of read operations performed by the storage system per second. It is a crucial metric for understanding the read performance of storage devices.</p> <ul> <li>CPU's</li> </ul> <p>CPU's (Central Processing Units) refers to the processors in a server or machine that handle the execution of tasks. This can include the number of physical CPUs and the number of cores within each CPU.</p> <ul> <li>Write IOPS</li> </ul> <p>Write IOPS measures the number of write operations performed by the storage system per second. It is a key metric for understanding the write performance of storage devices.</p> <ul> <li>Cores</li> </ul> <p>Cores refer to the individual processing units within a CPU. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The number of cores is a significant factor in determining a CPU\u2019s processing power.</p> <ul> <li>Memory</li> </ul> <p>Memory refers to the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) available in a system. It is used to store data temporarily for quick access by the CPU. More memory allows for better performance, especially for applications and databases that require large amounts of data to be processed quickly.</p> <ul> <li>Total Throughput</li> </ul> <p>Total throughput refers to the total amount of data processed by a system or network in a given period of time. It is often measured in terms of data transfer rate, such as megabytes per second (MB/s) or gigabits per second (Gbps). Throughput is a critical metric for assessing the performance of storage systems, networks, and databases, indicating how efficiently data is being handled.</p> <ul> <li>Total IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)</li> </ul> <p>Total IOPS measures the number of input/output operations a storage system can handle per second. It is a key performance indicator for storage devices like SSDs, HDDs, and SANs, especially in environments with high transaction rates. Higher IOPS indicates better performance, as it means the storage system can handle more read/write operations in a given time frame.</p> <ul> <li>CPU\u2019s Total Capacity</li> </ul> <p>CPU\u2019s total capacity refers to the total processing power of a CPU, typically measured in gigahertz (GHz) and core count. It can be described as the cumulative computational ability of all the cores in a CPU, determining how many tasks it can handle simultaneously and how fast it can process data. Factors like clock speed, number of cores, and architectural efficiency contribute to the total capacity of a CPU.</p> <ul> <li>ORA Use</li> </ul> <p>ORA use likely refers to Oracle database usage. In a database context, ORA (short for Oracle) is used to indicate metrics or statistics related to the utilization and performance of an Oracle database system. This can include various aspects like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and database transactions, helping administrators optimize and monitor the database\u2019s performance.</p> <ul> <li>Source CPU\u2019s HT Factor</li> </ul> <p>Source CPU\u2019s HT (Hyper-Threading) factor refers to the use of Intel\u2019s Hyper-Threading Technology in the source CPU. Hyper-Threading allows a single physical processor core to behave like two logical cores, enabling better utilization of the CPU resources and improving parallelism. The HT factor indicates whether Hyper-Threading is enabled and to what extent it enhances the CPU\u2019s ability to handle concurrent threads.</p> <ul> <li>Estimated AZURE vCPU</li> </ul> <p>Estimated Azure vCPU refers to the virtual CPU equivalent in Microsoft Azure\u2019s cloud computing environment. A vCPU (virtual CPU) is a unit of computational resource in Azure's virtual machines. Estimating Azure vCPUs involves determining the number of virtual CPUs needed based on the workload requirements, often by translating physical CPU cores from on-premises systems to Azure's virtual environment. This estimation helps in planning and migrating workloads to Azure, ensuring adequate performance and resource allocation.</p>"},{"location":"Preparation%20of%20Analysis/#summary","title":"SUMMARY","text":"<p>By Default these are the sheets which are available in the Analysis Template.</p> <ul> <li>AWR data</li> <li>Host wise analysis</li> <li>Database analysis</li> <li>Placements</li> <li>Cost</li> <li>Multiple factor</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Preparation%20of%20Analysis/#awr-data","title":"AWR DATA","text":"Manual Input Automatically detected DB name Total throughput Read Throughput Total IOPS Instance Name CPU\u2019s total capacity Write Throughput ORA use CPU Source CPU\u2019s HT factor Cores Estimated AZURE vCPU Memory Host NAME Elapsed Time(mins) DB Time SGA PGA DB IO Read (IOPS) DB IO Write (IOPS) DB IO Read (BPS) DB IO Write (BPS) <p>Refer to the screenshots attached below</p> <p>1.
